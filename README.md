## Features
- NMEA 2000 capture
- SignalK integration
- CAN replay tools

## Set-Up
Before beginning forensic analysis of the vessel, it is essential to properly set up the investigative environment by installing all required tools and dependencies. The /Set_Up directory contains the installation packages, configuration files, and scripts necessary to prepare the system for analysis. This step ensures that all components—such as data parsers, log viewers, NMEA 2000 interpreters, and replay utilities—are correctly configured and ready to interface with the vessel’s data sources. Proper installation from the /Set_Up directory minimizes compatibility issues, enables consistent tool performance, and establishes a reliable foundation for subsequent stages of forensic examination, including data acquisition, parsing, and replay of Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) information.
